There are 4 access modifier in java
    -public
    -default
    -protected
    -private

   * access modifier alanlar variables-constructor-methods

   **public**
   the access level is everywhere
   what does it mean everywhere?
    -current class ( kendi clası) -outside the curent class within package (class dışı)-
    and outsize packed( kendi packed dışı)

    **default**
    The access level is only within package
    if we do not type any access modifier, it will be default

    **protected**
    if there is not any relation between classes, protected access modifier is like default
    but there is parent-child relation between classses, child class can reach parent class, even if it is outside package
    (for data member and methods)

    **private**
    The access level is only within the class.
    it cannot reach from outside the class

    **private constructor role**
    you can not create tle instance of outof class

    **method overloading**
    ot be more restrictive override method in child class

    **local variables**
    dont have modifier
